    <h4>1. Can you provide a brief overview of the history of JavaScript and its significance in web development? </h4>
    <p>JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript
        as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.</p>

    <h4>2. What are the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript? </h4>
    <p>The fundamentals of JavaScript are the building blocks of the language. These include variables, data types,
        control structures, functions, and objects. </p>

    <h4>3. Explain the basic syntax of JavaScript. </h4>
    <p> The syntax of JavaScript is the set of rules defining valid programming
        statements. Javascript's syntax is similar to C and Java: it is case-sensitive, statements end with semicolons,
        and curly braces are used to mark blocks of code.</p>

    <h4>4. How does JavaScript differ from other programming languages? </h4>
    <p>Most programming languages are compiled, meaning that the code must be compiled into machine code before it can
        be run. On the other hand, JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that it does not need to be compiled
        before it can be run.</p>

    <h4>5. What are the best practices to write clean and efficient JavaScript code? </h4>
